#Goal :
## Explore Human-Object Interaction, emphasizing non-verbal communication


##Main research Activities 
* communications
Intentional / Unintentional
Assistant vs. Tool
Manifestation vs. Manipulation

* Intentional communications goals:
Instrumental - Transforming communications with object (it) to subjective (you).
Wiki: [Martin Buber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber "Wiki") - [I and Thou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_and_Thou), Hebrew [article](http://www.mofet.macam.ac.il/ktiva/kivunim/article22/Pages/meyou.aspx)
    Improve interpersonal communications (or reciprocal communication)


###Keywords
Mutual learning
Environment - User Communications (object-subject, object-objects, ...)

Emotion Analysis
Personification
Theory of equal mind

#Marketing Pitch
<!-- this relates to lights only, maybe expand it to more projects-->

\- How many times did you light a lamp in your lifetime? 10,000 times? 100,000 times?
How many times did you light the wrong lamp? didn't have enough light? would you prefer the light to be in different color or direction? or you would prefer the light be stronger on the book that you read and weaker elsewhere? 
What if all that is going to change, and you will have a light just for you, doing exactly what you need?
<!--
and the answer to all of the above questions would be:
"Well, I never thought about it. there was no need for that,-->

\- Well, I love the lighting system in Enterprise 5.

#Projects
* Roomie: a room tuning parameters based on user activity
Related:
 1. Music Room - shapes and colors that interact with movements in the room and rhythm 
2. A room with rich illumination that learn where is your books sofa and try to make perfect illumination for that, the musical corner , the eating corner, tv corner etc 
3. (Influenced by MIT guys) A TV which has its own illumination sources so that you can see light flashing outside the screen, A TV with light surround
4. Games with light sources as hints to what is going to happen next, imagine someone is shooting at you and you hear the sound and light from the right directions
5. Emotion Transfer games - you do some emotion the room is changed both in music and illumination according to that, this create another emotion on other people on the room which influence the room again and so on 
6. smart houses, objects aware of environment and neighboring objects. 
Generate 100 emotion rooms. Goal - Resonate / change the emotional state / mood. 
Psychological verification:
identify an emotion
reinforce the emotion
balance / change the emotion
When do we need each of these?


* Lamp(ard): 
the reduction of this question to almost philosophical level: a single binary output (lamp on/off) with a single function (to provide light) and a lot of inputs.
 Streching the theory of mind - connecting with an object that tries to optimze its likability. “lamp pet” as an example. Start with innate optimization (face time) and have the device learn what draws human attention. Must avoid becoming annoying. Use this as a test bed for exploring the establishment of communications.
example: [Pinokio](http://vimeo.com/53476316)


* Measure correlation of physiological with unintentional behaviour 
 for Pre-communication intent identification

* Object-Subject Relations
reciprocity - Meeting points between two subjects (and not subject-object)
subject - an entity with desires, needs and self definition
object - an entity serving a subject
subjectivity evolves first from seeing someone else (eg mother) as an object (satisfying needs) however in addition there’s a need for the subject to have recognition from another subject

* Illusions of intelligence: eye contact, breathing, nodding, tz tz tz

* Theory-of-mind model (aka: TOM)
Six levels of intelligent interaction:
1. Static (non-interactive): 
2. Responsive deterministic
3. Adaptive to a static environment
4. Adaptive to the user
5. Establishing communication with the user
6. Full theory-of-mind 
Experiments:
Quantitative: Measure the Learning time of Levels 2-4 vs. Level-5
Qualitative: Given 4 kinds of object, what would you prefer? <!-- "we need to make them cry if we will take it from them..."-->

* I like to move it move it (aka: Il-Tmimi)
Gesture\Emotion  viral  behavior - you do some move because you like it the creatures on your room imitate you but they have mutations, then you see something which is nice and you imitate that than all imitate you , [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy11lkBvA9s)
Animals that interact with you on the walls not just appear or disappear but dance and jump show you the way to the couch go to the places you like most and so on, virtual pets that actually live on your walls ( if you make them look like lice or bugs it will be interesting to some of us) 


* DoorHandle
An object that learns the behavior of other objects.
[project page](http://eranws.github.com/behavior/)

* Security: 
Code with Dance or hand gestures: "5326, Peace, Thumb up"


* Monkey in the Bush - A Motion/Emotion correllator
You do the movement - I find a movie or image of someone else do a similar move, or reflect with animation using motion capture. [example]("http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_k9YRGIDlJZw/S5DwR1SuX0I/AAAAAAAACfc/WvykSiioesM/s1600/Bush+Monkey.jpg" "Animals will make it fun")

* communications augmenting tool
Warning for parents about childrens emotional state.
Teachers tool - real time feedback (e.g. color coding) of the student’s state
Learning tool - identify attentional state and modify content / medium

* gesture API
dictionary of gestures, start with a database of gestures+semantics and generalize from the examples to all cultural depndant body language.
consider replacing data collection from batch to online in a real world environment interacting with objects.

 * Should bundle with a testbed / demo application.

* MySofa - automatically responding to the user needs
[project page](http://eranws.github.com/behavior/MySofa.html)
What makes a really good sofa?
Is it her color? her position in the room? or maybe her proportions? There are so many parameters that we can tweak to find the best one.
What if I want her to change according to my mood, or the activity I'm involved in?
modify: softness / angle / height
could be any other furniture: bed, chair, shelf


* other
(those need some elaboration)
Driving
Keyboard
Browser activities
Projector based
Color balance - warm
Interactive pot
Virtual Aquarium (you are the fish or the octupus ) 
Ball games on the wall
Emotion trainer - (or: how to become a psycho)
low bandwidth output
Depth movies
Identifying loops


##Metrics

Persicion
Physiological comfort  
Novelty
Respect
Reciproicity
Affection
Enjoyment
Frustration
Impact

Ease of implementation / price
Clean / simplicity (Occam razor)



## Issues / Discussions
Should we start with reciprocal illusions?
is similarity needed?
what objects do we want to keep as objects - even a King needs quite time
