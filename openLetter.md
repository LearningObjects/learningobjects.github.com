An open letter to the Learning objects research group:

I feel that we lost our track in our last meeting.
Let's look back at what we defined in the first meeting as our goal:
*"explore Human-Object Interaction emphasizing nonverbal communication"*

We already have a nice list of projects. There should be some metrics for those. for each project we need to ask:

* does [he]() explore Human-Object Interaction?
* is [he]() emphasizing nonverbal communication
* what is the communication model? (verbal/non, intentional/non)
* who are the participants? (human-human, human-object, object-object, object-human, object)
* multi-human, multi-object
* ...

By "grading" these projects we can focus better on what projects are more fit to the research group.

The question is: who is going to implement it? [](story:phoneDebugger)
Well, one of our goals is to expand into 8 members by January 13, therefore we need a short list of projects that we can "sell" to the group prospective students.

One more thing.
I think that a brainstorming session should be putting many project ideas on the table.
We went too deep for too little projects, we got into technical details, before we asked if the jubject is of any interest.
For now we can put aside technical issues.

Elevator Pitch - a one liner that describes the project. If it needs more than that then put it in a separate file.

Shabat Shalom and Happy Hanukah.
